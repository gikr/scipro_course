    "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton. The \"game\" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive (1) or dead (0). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies**, as if by needs caused by underpopulation.\n",
    "- **Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies**, as if by overcrowding.\n",
    "- **Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives**, unchanged, to the next generation.\n",
    "- **Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial pattern constitutes the 'seed' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed – births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. (In other words, each generation is a pure function of the one before.) The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n",

    "Implement a simple version of the game of life, and initialize it with a 100x100 random matrix of 0-1 values (use the numpy.random.randint function for this). Execute a number of steps and see how your system is evolving over time by printing the total number of cells (ones) in your Petri dish (matrix). You can visualize the position of your cells by calling the function spy() from the matplotlib package on your matrix\n",
